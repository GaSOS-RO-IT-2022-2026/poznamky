2000
- Windows Mylenia - Was much hated, so users used a 2000-like NTOS called Windows Workstation
- 2000 (NTOS) - Ment for servers

2001
- Windows XP

2006
- Windows Vista - Heavy mf, was skipped by users when XP dropped support. Aero UI

2009
- Windows 7 - Optimalised

2012
- Windows 8 and 8.1 - Metro UI, was designed more to be used on tablet laptops and touch screens. Was kind of a meme and inconvience on desktop computers. Just like Vista, Windows 7 users skipped past Windows 8 and 8.1 when it dropped support, and started using Windows 10.

2015
- Windows 10 - Start menu brought back. Had a feel of Aero but still kept some features introduced in windows 8.

2020
- Windows 11 - Had hard-built hardware limits, required UEFI. Walk arounds were found by editing registry to install on older hardware.
